  <h5>My response to this case study was prepared with the following <strong>assumptions</strong> in mind.</h5>
  <ul>
            <li><strong>Short timeframe. </strong>The summative math assessment is coming up quickly. The principal needs to do something even more quickly in order to have a chance of improving performance. I've priorizied actionability and fast turnaround over exploring every possible angle.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparable historical data. </strong>I've been informed that, for this case study, I should assume robust data regarding the current 5th grade class. I am also assuming equally robust and comparable data regarding previous 5th grade classes - some degree of year-over-year consistency in when and how indicators are measured.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottom line over methodology. </strong>I'm assuming the principal doesn't really care about how I reached my conclusions as long as I can succinctly explain why I was justified in reaching them. I've left out almost all details about the methods themselves, focusing instead on the results. </li>
            <li><strong>In-person contact. </strong>This site is barely a stand-alone document. I designed it that way. In a real-world scenario I would use this site as a read-ahead and as a refernce to facilitate an in-person conversation with the principal.</li>
            <li><strong>Meeting in the middle. </strong>While I never assume that anyone wants jargon, I do assume the principal is willing to become an educated consumer of analysis. I can and will explain any concept or procedure a person wants to understand, but I've seen little good come from analogizing a technical concept to the point that a consumer thinks he or she does not need to ask questions about it.</li>

You can see that some indicators had a single most important exemplar while other indicators were predictive when taken all together.
